The Spurs are shooting 3/5 from the field (60%) while the Suns are struggling at 1/7 (14%)\n2. Phoenix is missing open shots - Durant is 1/3, Booker 0/2, and they've already missed two three-point attempts\n3. Chris Paul already has 2 assists for the Spurs, showing good ball movement\n4. Nick Richards is active on the boards with 2 offensive rebounds but missed a dunk opportunity\n\nThe Suns need to find their rhythm quickly - their star players (Durant/Booker) are cold to start. Meanwhile, the Spurs' veteran backcourt (Paul/Fox) is controlling the tempo well."

Booker's return could be the spark Phoenix needs."
