Richards is active on offensive boards (2 rebounds) but missed a dunk.\n3. Key trend: Spurs are capitalizing on transition opportunities while the Suns' half-court offense looks disjointed so far.\n\nWant me to watch for anything specific as the game progresses?"

Booker is 0/4 with 2 assists but struggling to score.  \n2. **Spurs' backcourt dominance**: Fox/Paul have 9 of Spurs' 11 points (CP3 just hit a tough 26-footer). Their chemistry is evident with 3 assists already.  \n3. **Timeout drama**: Suns called a full timeout AND challenged a call (likely reviewing CP3's last shot). Could be a momentum swing opportunity.  \n\nBiggest concern for Phoenix: Their offense is too reliant on Durant (2/4 FG) while others are ice-cold. Spurs' defense (4 defensive rebounds for Biyombo) is disrupting their rhythm.  \n\nWant me to track any specific matchup? Maybe Booker vs. Fox?"

Spurs also had 1 (Sochan's lost ball).  \n2. **Bench impact**: Beal immediately contributed 2 pts + 1 ast, while Spurs' Castle/Sochan combined for 2 pts but shaky ball security.  \n3. **Foul trouble**: CP3 picked up his 2nd foul (on Richards' and-1) and got subbed out - could be crucial later.  \n\nBiggest shift: Suns' defense tightened after the timeout (forced 2 Spurs turnovers), but their offense still looks disjointed (Booker now 0/4 with 2 TOs).
